# IAMSecure

IAMSecure is a microservices-based application focused on Identity and Access Management (IAM) solutions in the realm of cybersecurity. This project aims to provide a robust and scalable platform for managing user identities, authentication, and authorization in modern software applications.

## Overview

IAMSecure is divided into two main microservices:

1. **Auth Service**: Responsible for handling user authentication and token generation.
2. **User Service**: Manages user profiles, permissions, and access control.

The microservices architecture allows for modularity, flexibility, and scalability, enabling easy integration with existing systems and the ability to scale components independently as needed.

## Features

- **Authentication**: Supports various authentication methods, including username/password authentication and token-based authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **Authorization**: Implements role-based access control (RBAC) and fine-grained permissions management to control user access to resources.
- **User Management**: Provides CRUD operations for managing user profiles, enabling administrators to create, update, delete, and retrieve user information.
- **Security**: Implements security best practices to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of user data. Includes features such as password hashing, token validation, and secure communication protocols.
- **Scalability**: Built with scalability in mind, allowing the application to handle growing user bases and increasing loads by scaling individual microservices horizontally or vertically.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Integrates with monitoring and logging tools to track performance metrics, detect errors, and troubleshoot issues in real-time.
